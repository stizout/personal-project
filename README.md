<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  This is a basic clone of the website Boxed.com. This application allows someone to purchase products by category, sort by price and add them to a cart that exists on the same page as the dashboard. Unlike other conventional sites where you can't see your cart unless you click "Cart", boxed.com allows the user to always see what they are buying and delete from it right from the same page! This project was what i chose for my Dev Mountain Personal Project.
